CGI::Untaint::boolean
--------------------------

Version 0.10, Sat Jun 26 22:16:46 UTC 2004

Untaint boolean values from CGI forms.

This CGI::Untaint input handler verifies that it is dealing with a reasonable
boolean value, probably from a checkbox with no value specified. In this case,
"reasonable" means that the value is on, if the checkbox is checked, or empty,
if the client did not send a value.
