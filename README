CGI::Untaint::boolean
---------------------

Version 1.00, Fri Jul  8 06:58:28 UTC 2005

Untaint boolean values from CGI forms.

This CGI::Untaint input handler verifies that it is dealing with a reasonable
boolean value, probably from a checkbox with no value specified. In this case,
"reasonable" means that the value is on, if the checkbox is checked, or empty,
if the client did not send a value.

Prerequisites
-------------

To run this module, you need CGI::Untaint 1.00 or newer.

To test this module, you need Scalar::Util, Test::Simple 0.47 or newer, and
Test::CGI::Untaint 1.10 or newer.

Installation
------------

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ ./Build
	$ ./Build test
	$ sudo ./Build install

If you're old-school, you can also use Makefile.PL, but it doesn't distinguish
between build-and runtime requirements, so consider carefully your options.
